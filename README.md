PHRoute - Fast request router for PHP
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MindyPHP/Mindy_Router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MindyPHP/Mindy_Router)

## This library provides a fast implementation of a regular expression based router.

 * Super fast
 * Route parameters and optional route parameters
 * Named routes and reverse routing
 * Restful controller routing
 * Route filters and route groups

### Credit to nikic/FastRoute. 

While the bulk of the library and extensive unit tests are my own, credit for the regex matching core implementation and benchmarking goes to [nikic](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute). Please go and read nikic's 
[blog post explaining how the implementation works and why it's fast.](http://nikic.github.io/2014/02/18/Fast-request-routing-using-regular-expressions.html)

Many modifications to the core have been made to suit the new library wrapper, and additional features added such as optional route parameters and reverse routing etc, but please head over and checkout nikic's library to see the origins of the core and how it works.


Installation
------------
Install via composer

```
{
    "require": {
        "mindy/router": "2.*"
    }
}

```

Usage
-----

### Defining routes

The routes are added by calling `addRoute($method, $route, $handler)` on the `Phroute\RouteCollector` collector instance.

~~~PHP
  #NB. You can also call the HTTP method short cuts: 
 $routeCollector->get($route, $handler);    # match only get request methods
 $routeCollector->post($route, $handler);   # match only post request methods
 $routeCollector->delete($route, $handler); # match only delete request methods
 $routeCollector->any($route, $handler);    # match any request method
 etc...
~~~

This method accepts the HTTP method the route must match, the route pattern, an associated
handler and an optional array of 'before' and 'after' filters. The handler does not necessarily have 
to be a callback (it could also be a controller class name and method or any other kind of data you wish to 
associate with the route).

By default a route pattern syntax is used where `{foo}` specified a placeholder with name `foo`
and matching the string `[^/]+`. To adjust the pattern the placeholder matches, you can specify
a custom pattern by writing `{bar:[0-9]+}`. However, it is also possible to adjust the pattern
syntax by passing using a different route parser.


```php

$router = new Phroute\RouteCollector(new Phroute\RouteParser);


$router->any('/example', function(){
    return 'This route responds to any method (POST, GET, DELETE etc...) at the URI /example';
});

// or '/page/{id:i}' (see shortcuts)

$router->post('/page/{id:\d+}', function($id){

    // $id contains the url paramter
    
    return 'This route responds to the post method at the URI /page/{param} where param is at least one number';
});

$router->any('/', function(){

    return 'This responds to the default route';
});

// Optional Parameters
// simply add a '?' after the route name to make the parameter optional
// NB. be sure to add a default value for the function argument
$router->addRoute('GET', '/user/{id}?', function($id = null) {
    return 'second';
});

# NB. You can cache this object so you don't have to create the routes each request - massive speed gains
$dispatcher = new Phroute\Dispatcher($router);

$response = $dispatcher->dispatch($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
    
// Print out the value returned from the dispatched function
echo $response;

```

### Regex Shortcuts

```

:i => :/d+                # numbers only
:a => :[a-zA-Z0-9]+       # alphanumeric
:c => :[a-zA-Z0-9+_-\.]+  # alnumnumeric and + _ - . characters 
:h => :[a-fA-F0-9]+       # hex

use in routes:

'/user/{name:i}'
'/user/{name:a}'

```

###Named Routes for Reverse Routing

Pass in an array as the first argument, where the first item is your route and the second item is a name with which to reference it later.

```php
$router->get(['/user/{name}', 'username'], function($name){
    return 'Hello ' . $name;
})
->get(['/page/{slug}/{id:\d+}', 'page'], function($id){
    return 'You must be authenticated to see this page: ' . $id;
});

// Use the routename and pass in any route parameters to reverse engineer an existing route path
// If you change your route path above, you won't need to go through your code updating any links/references to that route
$router->route('username', 'joe');
// string(9) '/user/joe'

$router->route('page', ['intro', 456]);
// string(15) '/page/intro/456'

```


###Controllers

```php
class Test {
    
    public function anyIndex()
    {
        return 'This is the default page and will respond to /controller and /controller/index';
    }
    
    /**
    * One required paramter and one optional parameter
    */
    public function anyTest($param, $param2 = 'default')
    {
        return 'This will respond to /controller/test/{param}/{param2}? with any method';
    }
    
    public function getTest()
    {
        return 'This will respond to /controller/test with only a GET method';
    }
    
    public function postTest()
    {
        return 'This will respond to /controller/test with only a POST method';
    }
    
    public function putTest()
    {
        return 'This will respond to /controller/test with only a PUT method';
    }
    
    public function deleteTest()
    {
        return 'This will respond to /controller/test with only a DELETE method';
    }
}

$router->controller('/controller', 'Test');
```


### Dispatching a URI

A URI is dispatched by calling the `dispatch()` method of the created dispatcher. This method
accepts the HTTP method and a URI. Getting those two bits of information (and normalizing them
appropriately) is your job - this library is not bound to the PHP web SAPIs.

$response = (new Phroute\Dispatcher($router))
            ->dispatch($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);

The `dispatch()` method will call the matched route, or if no matches, throw one of the exceptions below:

    # Route not found
    Phroute\Exception\HttpRouteNotFoundException;
    
    # Route found, but method not allowed
    Phroute\Exception\HttpMethodNotAllowedException;

> **NOTE:** The HTTP specification requires that a `405 Method Not Allowed` response include the
`Allow:` header to detail available methods for the requested resource. 
This information can be obtained from the thrown exception's message content:
which will look like: `"Allow: HEAD, GET, POST"` etc... depending on the methods you have set
You should catch the exception and use this to send a header to the client: `header($e->getMessage());`


### A Note on HEAD Requests

The HTTP spec requires servers to [support both GET and HEAD methods][2616-511]:

> The methods GET and HEAD MUST be supported by all general-purpose servers

To avoid forcing users to manually register HEAD routes for each resource we fallback to matching an
available GET route for a given resource. The PHP web SAPI transparently removes the entity body
from HEAD responses so this behavior has no effect on the vast majority of users.

However, implementors using Phroute outside the web SAPI environment (e.g. a custom server) MUST
NOT send entity bodies generated in response to HEAD requests. If you are a non-SAPI user this is
*your responsibility*; Phroute has no purview to prevent you from breaking HTTP in such cases.

Finally, note that applications MAY always specify their own HEAD method route for a given
resource to bypass this behavior entirely.


### Performance

Performed on a machine with :

 * Processor  2.3 GHz Intel Core i7
 * Memory  8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3

####Phroute

This test is to illustrate, in part, the efficiency of the lightweight routing-core, but mostly the lack of degradation of matching speed as the number of routes grows, as compared to conventional libraries.

Please note, this is no slight against laravel - it is based on a routing loop, which is why the performance worsens as the number of routes grows
